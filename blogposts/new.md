In a year in university I learned how to make a basic circuit on a basic board. Just putting the components on the right holes on the board and just like that. So I basically learn the LED, resistance and how to make circuit with them. But I didn’t made any solder in university and I also want to learn make circuits with using solder. I started with an basic circuit I used a LED, a 1kΩ resistance and a 12V power source.

Let me explain a bit. I just found that circuit with just 3 LEDs at home. I checked all cables and I just decided to use the middle LED. Then I brazed the LED, the resistance and the power source. Finally, I made my goal.
I tried to make the circuit with two LEDs but I can’t make the solder to it. It instantaneously melts every time.

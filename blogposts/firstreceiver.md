In this attempt I tried to find 555 microchip but I couldn’t find it at home so I tried a different thing. I found a receiver circuit that is used for listening a frequency interval in walkie-talkie technology. This circuit was already prepared but it hasn’t got a speaker. I found a speaker and I brazed the speaker to the circuit. It was a quite easy but I think this is a step. My dad said that I should use a 9V power source but tried the circuit with 12V power source and it worked (I didn’t smelled bad). When it worked I hear some sizzle but I can’t hear any voice in that frequency interval. I think no one is using that frequency interval at that time with walkie-talkies. Lastly, I learn a different old thing. The circuit has an analog frequency changer. At the left bottom corner you can see the antenna (the little metal, vertical thing) and at the right of the antenna you can see the analog frequency changer. It changes frequency with a screwdriver (It works like put the screwdriver to the gap at the top of changer then screwing it).
